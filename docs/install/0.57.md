# MPF 0.57 changes (current "dev" branch)

*Last updated October 14, 2023*

The dev branch of MPF is now v0.57. (Technically `0.57.0.dev20` as of this writing, though the dev version number changes frequently.)

## Big changes in 0.57

* Adds support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (3.8 and 3.9 are still supported. 3.7 might work but is no longer being tested)
* Changes the YAML interface to remove "hacks" we added years ago. Now MPF supports the pure YAML spec.
  * This requires [some changes](../config/instructions/config_v6.md) (not too bad) to your config files.
  * Config files are now `config_version=6`
  * Show files are now `show_version=6`
* Completely overhauled FAST Pinball platform interface, with support for the FAST Neuron Controller and Expansion Boards

### Other smaller changes in 0.57

* Improved the algorithm for how RGB colors are mapped to RGBW LEDs.
* Removed the config file migrator (hasn't been used in years)

## How to install MPF dev / 0.57

The installation packages have been published, so you can install via `pip` just like how you install MPF. Just add the `--pre` flag to install the pre-release version:

``` {.bash .copy}
pip3 install mpf --pre
```

If you want to install a new version of Python (like 3.11), you can, and run it side-by-side your existing version. Then you can access Python 3.11 and pip for Python 3.11 via `pip3.11 install mpf --pre`

### MPF Monitor 0.57

The dev branch of MPF Monitor is now 0.57.0.devXX as well. You can install it via `pip` with the `--pre` flag as well.

``` {.bash .copy}
pip3 install mpf-monitor --pre
```

## MPF-MC 0.57

You can install the latest version of MPF-MC from the dev branch as well. (It's also 0.57.0.devXX.)

``` {.bash .copy}
pip3 install mpf-mc --pre
```

We had some issues with audio in earlier builds of MPF-MC 0.57, but we think those are resolved? Open an Issue on
GitHub if you have any issues with sound not working.

## Upgrading to MPF 0.57

Here's what it will take to upgrade to MPF 0.57:

* If you're on Python 3.7, you'll need to update.
* If you're on Python 3.8 or 3.9, you do not have to change your Python version.
* If you want, you can use Python 3.10 or 3.11.
* Update your config files to config_version 6

## YAML changes in MPF 0.57 / config version 6

Since MPF 0.57 removes the older YAML hacks we did years ago, you will need to update your config files. Because this is a config file change, MPF 0.57 moves from `config_version=5` to `config_version=6`.

The full guide to how to update your config files is [here](../config/instructions/config_v6.md)
